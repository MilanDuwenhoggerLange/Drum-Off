## 1. Getting Started

To begin using Drum-Off, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari). You'll see the main interface featuring:
*   Drum pad buttons
*   A volume slider
*   A beat sequencer grid
*   Recording controls
*   An "App Instructions" button

## 2. Playing Drum Sounds (Pads & Keyboard)

The core of Drum-Off is the set of nine drum pads. Each pad represents a different drum sound and displays its name and corresponding keyboard shortcut:

*   **Kick** (Q)
*   **Ride** (W)
*   **Snare** (E)
*   **Tom** (R)
*   **Hi-Hat** (T)
*   **Clap** (Y)
*   **Open Hi-Hat** (U)
*   **Tink** (I)
*   **Boom** (O)

**To play a sound:**
*   **Click:** Simply click on the desired drum pad button.
*   **Keyboard:** Press the corresponding key shown in parentheses on the button (see Section 6 for a full list).

When a sound is triggered, the corresponding pad will briefly glow cyan for visual feedback. You can trigger multiple sounds quickly to create rhythms.

## 3. Using the Volume Control

Located below the drum pads is a volume control section:

*   **Label:** Clearly marked "Volume:".
*   **Slider:** A horizontal range slider controls the overall volume.
    *   Slide the thumb control **right** to increase the volume.
    *   Slide the thumb control **left** to decrease the volume.
*   This affects the volume of **all** drum sounds played via pads, keyboard, sequencer, or recording playback. The initial volume is set to maximum (1).

## 4. Using the Beat Sequencer

The beat sequencer allows you to program repeating drum patterns:

*   **Grid:** You'll see a grid below the "Beat Sequencer" title.
    *   Each **row** corresponds to one of the drum sounds.
    *   Each **column** represents a step (beat) in the sequence. There are 8 beats in total.
*   **Programming:** Click any square (beat) in the grid to toggle it **on** (it turns cyan) or **off** (it becomes empty). An "on" beat means that instrument will play at that step in the sequence.
*   **Playback:**
    *   Click the **"Play/Stop Sequence"** button to start playback. The sequence will loop automatically.
    *   Click the **"Play/Stop Sequence"** button again to stop playback.
*   **Tempo:** The sequencer plays at a fixed tempo (approximately 120 BPM, set to 250ms per beat in the code).
*   **Real-time Editing:** You can add or remove beats from the sequence grid even while it is playing.

## 5. Recording and Playing Back Manual Input

Drum-Off allows you to record and play back your *manual* drum performances.

**Important Note:** This feature records the drum sounds you trigger **manually** by clicking the pads or using the keyboard shortcuts. It **does not** automatically record the output generated by the beat sequencer.

*   **Start Recording:** Click the **"Record"** button.
    *   The button will disable itself, turn red, and start pulsing to indicate recording is active.
    *   The **"Stop"** button will become enabled.
    *   The **"Play Recording"** button will be disabled.
*   **Perform:** Play your drum sounds using the pads or keyboard. The timing and sound of each hit are captured relative to when you started recording.
*   **Stop Recording:** Click the now-enabled **"Stop"** button.
    *   Recording ceases.
    *   The "Record" button becomes enabled again and loses its red style.
    *   The "Stop" button becomes disabled.
    *   The **"Play Recording"** button becomes enabled (if any sounds were recorded).
*   **Playback Recording:** Click the **"Play Recording"** button.
    *   Your manually recorded performance will play back with the original timing.
    *   During playback, the "Play Recording" and "Record" buttons are temporarily disabled. They re-enable once playback is complete.
*   **Re-record:** You can start a new recording at any time by clicking "Record" again, which will overwrite the previous recording.

## 6. Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

Use these keys for quick triggering of drum sounds:

*   **Q:** Kick
*   **W:** Ride
*   **E:** Snare
*   **R:** Tom
*   **T:** Hi-Hat
*   **Y:** Clap
*   **U:** Open Hi-Hat
*   **I:** Tink
*   **O:** Boom

## 7. Accessing App Instructions

Need a reminder while using the app?
*   Click the **"App Instructions"** button located in the top-right corner of the window.
*   This will open a pop-up (modal) window displaying this user manual.
*   Click the "Close" button within the pop-up, or click on the dark background area outside the content box, to dismiss the instructions.

## 8. Tips and Tricks

*   **Layering:** Use the beat sequencer to create a basic backing rhythm, then play additional drum sounds live using the pads or keyboard over the top.
*   **Manual Patterns:** Use the recording feature to capture your manually played rhythms and patterns, then play them back.
*   **Experiment:** Combine different sounds and sequence patterns to discover unique beats.
*   **Performance:** Utilize the keyboard shortcuts for faster and potentially more fluid drum triggering during live play or recording.
*   **Structure:** Think about creating different sequencer patterns that could represent verse, chorus, or bridge sections if you were building a full song.
*   **Advanced:** If you're comfortable editing code, you can adjust the `sequencerTempo` variable within the `script.js` file (lower number = faster tempo) to change the sequencer speed.
